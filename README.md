This is a Discord Bot Template For Personal Use.But If you want to use for personal use feel free do so.

# BasicCommnands

In the basic commands folder you will see basiccommands there will be ping, slap, lel, insta, help. I have made a basic commnand handeler so it easier to get to the point of code that you want. 

# Discord-Bot-Template

If come out of that Direcotry You Will Find Package.json, package-lock.json and drillbot.jsI am focusing on package.json for now 

In this file that you can open in any ide or text editor. You should find the name, the version, the main file, test, author, license, discord.js 
Change the author if you want a more custimized Experience. FYI that was a shameless self-promotion 
Custimize this how you wish.
